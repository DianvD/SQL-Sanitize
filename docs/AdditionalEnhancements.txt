Firstly I would start with security, what I mean is create user-based access. Only certain users can create,update,delete
and only certain users can actually access the sanitize endpoint.

Logging would also be nice, I am thinking of audit logs so that you can see who added, removed, or updated words.

Bulk changes would make this very cool, like import/export so that you can upload files with all sensitive words.

Adding a UI/Frontend for this would be ideal of course.

Maybe add a setting that allows the user to toggle between if they want to partial word matching or exact word matching.

Another upgrade could be adding rate limits on these endpoints so that it does not get spammed.
