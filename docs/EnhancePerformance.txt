I would start by finding a way hat I can cache the REGEX created for each word/phrase, perhaps storing this in the DB
as well. Just so that there is no need to recreate it on every request

I will look into loading the words into memory and then only if changes are made we refresh the list. This will save
time by not having to call the database for each sanitize request.

Currently, I am iterating over every word/phrase and masking then, I believe a better solution could be to

The update can perhaps also be done in batches rather than on each change, but this I think depends on the requirement

I would also add indexes on the db for faster retrieval there.

Another option could be that we look at using multiple threads to split the workload
